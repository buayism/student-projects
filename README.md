Bugema University open source student projects 

What is the Students-projects’ Repository?
The students’ repository is the central GitHub repository inside the Bugema Open Source Community (BOSC) organization where all student projects are hosted, developed, and managed.
Think of it as:
•	A shared development folder (online, GitHub-based).
•	A project showcase for Bugema University students.
•	A learning and collaboration hub where students practice real-world open source development.
Key Features of the Students’ Repository
1.	Centralized Projects
o	All student projects live inside one repository (organized by year and project name).
o	Easy to track contributions and progress.
2.	Structured Layout
Example:
3.	student-projects/
4.	├── Project-Templates/   # starter code for Python, Web, Mobile
5.	├── 2025/                # current year projects
6.	│   ├── Project-1/
7.	│   ├── Project-2/
8.	└── Archives/            # old projects
o	Each project has its own folder, documentation, and source code.
9.	Open Source Learning
o	Students learn industry-standard workflows: forking, branching, pull requests, code reviews.
o	They practice teamwork and version control.
10.	Community Governance
o	Maintainers (lecturers, senior students) review PRs.
o	Contributors (students) submit projects.
o	Ensures quality control and mentorship.
11.	Visibility & Portfolios
o	Students’ work is publicly visible on GitHub.
o	They can showcase contributions in CVs, LinkedIn, or job applications.
 How Students Use the Repository
1.	Fork & Clone
o	Each student forks student-projects repo to their GitHub account.
o	Clones locally to start working.
2.	Create a Project Folder
o	Inside 2025/, create 2025/Your-Project-Name/.
o	Add:
	src/ → source code
	docs/ → documentation
	README.md → project overview
3.	Develop & Commit
o	Students write code in their folder.
o	Commit changes with clear messages.
4.	Push & Pull Request
o	Push code to their fork.
o	Submit a Pull Request (PR) to merge into the main repo.
5.	Code Review & Merge
o	Maintainers review PRs.
o	Provide feedback if needed.
o	Once approved → project becomes part of BOSC repo.
Why This Matters for BOSC
•	Collaboration: Brings together students from different departments.
•	Visibility: Puts Bugema University on the open source map.
•	Skills: Students graduate with Git/GitHub experience, teamwork, and professional coding practice.
•	Innovation: Encourages real solutions (apps, tools, research software) to come out of BOSC.
